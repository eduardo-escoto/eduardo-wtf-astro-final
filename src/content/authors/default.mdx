Hey there! I&apos;m Ed :)

I am a first year Ph.D. Student at <a href="https://www.cse.ucsd.edu">UC San Diego</a> in the CSE department of the Jacobs School of Engineering.
I'm an NSF Fellow, funded through the CSGrad4US Fellowship focused on industry professionals aiming to complete a Ph.D. 
I'm currently advised by <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/">Julian McAuley</a> and I am a member of UCSD MUSAIC.
My current work is focused on Recommender Systems and Generative Music.

More casually, I am a massive dweeb for mathematics and probability, a connoisseur of
math rock and drum n bass, and I spend more time than I should playing
JRPGs and Souls-like games than I probably should.

I used to be a Senior Data Scientist at [Noom](https://www.noom.com/)
in New York where I focused on Growth. Before this, I was at <a href="https://afiniti.com">Afiniti</a> in Washington DC
where my work focused on Applied Artificial Intelligence. In my
undergrad I completed a double major in Mathematics and Statistics at <a href="https://www.ucsb.edu/">UC Santa Barbara</a>.
During my time at UCSB, I was a Data Science
Intern, and a Teaching Assistant in the <a href="https://cs.ucsb.edu/">UCSB Computer Science Department</a>.
